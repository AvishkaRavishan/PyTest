# Project Report

## 1. Project Plan

### Introduction

This section presents the initial plan for the project.

### Communication Plan

- **Frequency**: Twice a week (Tuesdays and Saturdays).
- **Platform**: Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp and GitHub for collaboration.
- **Commitments**: Each member commits their contributions on GitHub  when each task is completed.

### Schedule

The plan of tasks for each group member for the remainder of the project is:

| Week    | Task                         | Responsible Member |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Week 5  | Finalize Network Design      | [Name A]           |
| Week 6  | Research Cloud Providers     | [Name B]           |
| Week 7  | Conduct Risk Assessment      | Both               |
| Week 8  | Evaluate Ethical Issues      | [Name B]           |
| Week 9  | Compile Draft Report         | Both               |
| Week 10 | Record and Edit Presentation | Both               |

## 2. Network Design

### Overview

This section gives the detailed network design.

[Network Design Diagrams and Justifications](#network-design-diagrams-and-justifications) | [WiFi Design](#wifi-design) | [Address Allocations](#address-allocations) | [Recommended Hardware](#recommended-hardware) | [Plan](./plan.md) | [Cloud Services](./cloud.md) | [Security](./security.md) | [Ethics](./ethics.md) | [Reflection](./reflection.md) | [Return to index](./README.md)

### Network Design Diagrams and Justifications

- **Tool Used**: draw.io
- **Components Included**:
  - Internet Service Provider (ISP)
  - Firewalls
  - Routers and Switches
  - Wired and Wireless Access Points
  - Servers for the main office and management office
  - CCTV Cameras and RFID Systems

#### Justifications

- **Device Placement**: Access points in recreation and dining areas for optimal WiFi coverage.
- **Scalability**: Modular design for easy future expansions.
- **Security**: Segmented network with firewalls separating public, private, and administrative areas.

### WiFi Design

- **Settings**:
  - SSID: "ResHall_Network"
  - Encryption: WPA3
  - Channels: Non-overlapping channels for each access point
  - Power Levels: Adjusted for adequate coverage
- **Coverage Plan**:
  - Recreation and dining areas fully covered
  - Minimal interference between access points

### Address Allocations

- **Address Ranges**: Using /16 and /24 masks based on group member’s student ID (e.g., 36.1.0.0/16, 36.2.0.0/24).
- **Logic**: Each department and function has distinct IP ranges to minimize conflicts.

### Recommended Hardware

| Component    | Specification        | Cost (AUD) | Link              |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Router       | Dual WAN Gigabit     | $300       | [Example Link](#) |
| Access Point | WiFi 6, 1200 Mbps    | $150       | [Example Link](#) |
| CCTV Camera  | 1080p, Network Ready | $100       | [Example Link](#) |

### Contributions of Each Member

For each student in the group, state what parts they contribute to. For example "Steven did 50% of the Network Design, 90% of the security assessment and reviewed the ethical and social issues."

### Reflection on GitHub Commits

Include a screenshot showing commits and explain/reflect on the commit data. See Project Specification for detailed requirements.

### Reflection on Group Work
